/*

No scroll
---------

This helper is using when you want to force a no-scroll. In this app, we are using it to disable the page scroll,
for instance, when the sidebar off canvas menu is open or a modal window with scroll.

<div class="no-scroll">
  I'm poor, I have no scroll
</div>

*/

.no-scroll {
    overflow: hidden !important;
    position: relative;
}
